gastation_implementation
========================

The goal is to implement the interface of a gas station which has multiple gas pumps. Each  gas pump provides a specific amount of gas of a certain gas type.  Additionally, customers are requesting gas with different requirements regarding the  amount, type of gas and price they are willing to pay for it. Your implementation has to  take all this into account and serve gas when available. For further information please refer to the   documentation of our classes.
